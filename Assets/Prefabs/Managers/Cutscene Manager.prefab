  dialogue:
  - "Looking good, kid. I\u2019m telling ya, your food is a work of art."
  - You, my friend, are an artist. Your gift must be shared with the world.
  - "Oh, you know... I\u2019m just doing my job."
  - "Hey, don\u2019t be so humble! You\u2019re a real talent, I mean that."
  - "Listen, I know you\u2019ve been working to save up, pay off your debts, live
    on your own..."
  - "I\u2019m gonna really hate to see you go, kid."
  - "Well, I\u2019m not leaving anytime soon... I\u2019m nowhere close to paying
    off my debt yet..."
  - Maybe not yet, but after this next trip, you will be.
  - Trip?
  - What was I just saying?
  - "You\u2019re an artist with a message and that message happens to be food."
  - It needs to be shared with the world, and I can make that happen.
  - :O ?!??
  - "I\u2019m thinking a continental tour! You\u2019re gonna have to pick up some
    new recipes, learn what\u2019s popular with the locals..."
  - "It\u2019ll be hard, but I think you can do it."
  - You get to learn and grow as an artist, and even better, the two of us are going
    to make so much money!
  - ... whatcha think?
